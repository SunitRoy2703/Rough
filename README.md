# Google Summer of Code 2021 [@Tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow): Designing and Recreating Tensorflow Lite example NLP apps

>This serves as my final submission for Google Summer of Code 2021 project.

### Mentor:
* Meghna Natraj ([@meghnanatraj](https://github.com/MeghnaNatraj))

## Project Overview
Designing and Recreating new NLP TensorFlow Lite examples. This includes BERT Question and Answering, Text classification using the TensorFlow Lite Task Library which will be showcased in [TensorFlow Lite examples](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/examples). My as a GSoC student was to update the existing Natural Language Processing examples for these 2 tasks to use the [TensorFlow Lite Task Library](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/inference_with_metadata/task_library/overview) instead of custom code.
