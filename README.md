## Overview

This is an end-to-end example of [BERT] Question & Answer application built with
TensorFlow 2.0, and tested on [SQuAD] dataset version 1.1. The demo app provides
48 passages from the dataset for users to choose from, and gives 5 most possible
answers corresponding to the input passage and query.

These instructions walk you through running the demo on an Android device.For an explanation of the source, see
[TensorFlow Lite Android BERT QA Android example](EXPLORE_THE_CODE.md).

### Model used

[BERT], or Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, is a method
of pre-training language representations which obtains state-of-the-art results
on a wide array of Natural Language Processing tasks.

This app uses [MobileBERT], a compressed version of [BERT] that runs 4x faster and
has 4x smaller model size.

For more information, refer to the [BERT github page][BERT].


## Build the demo using Android Studio
                                                                                                                                          
### Prerequisites

*   If you don't have already, install
    [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html), following
    the instructions on the website.

*   Android Studio 3.2 or later.
    - Gradle 4.6 or higher.
    - SDK Build Tools 29.0.2 or higher.

*   You need an Android device or Android emulator and Android development
    environment with minimum API 15.

### Building

*   Open Android Studio, and from the Welcome screen, select `Open an existing
    Android Studio project`.

*   From the Open File or Project window that appears, navigate to and select
    the `bert_qa/android` directory from wherever you cloned the TensorFlow Lite
    sample GitHub repo.

*   You may also need to install various platforms and tools according to error
    messages.

*   If it asks you to use Instant Run, click Proceed Without Instant Run.

### Running

*   You need to have an Android device plugged in with developer options enabled
    at this point. See [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/device "Download Link")
    for more details on setting up developer devices.

*   If you already have Android emulator installed in Android Studio, select a
    virtual device with minimum API 15.

*   Click `Run` to run the demo app on your Android device.

## Build the demo using gradle (command line)

### Building and Installing

*   Use the following command to build a demo apk:

```
cd lite/examples/bert_qa/android   # Folder for Android app.

./gradlew build
```

*   Use the following command to install the apk onto your connected device:

```
adb install app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

## Assets folder

_Do not delete the assets folder content_. If you explicitly deleted the files,
choose `Build -> Rebuild` to re-download the deleted model files into the assets
folder.
